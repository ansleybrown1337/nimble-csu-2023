# A few administrative things

## Where to find stuff

The GitHub site ([https://github.com/nimble-training/nimble-csu-2023](https://github.com/nimble-training/nimble-csu-2023)) is the main repository for materials for the modules; you can also get the individual files from GitHub. 

If you're not familiar with Git, you can get these materials by simply going to [https://github.com/nimble-training/nimble-csu-2023](https://github.com/nimble-training/nimble-csu-2023) and click on the 'Download ZIP' button in the right side of the window or simply click [here](https://github.com/nimble-training/nimble-csu-2023/archive/main.zip). See also slide 6 in this document for how to get them using Git or from within RStudio.


## Asking questions and making comments

Please ask questions and make comments as we go through the material.

# RStudio and R Markdown

We'll present most of the material from within RStudio, using R Markdown documents with embedded R code. R Markdown is an extension to the Markdown markup language that makes it easy to write HTML in a simple plain text format.  This allows us to both run the R/NIMBLE code directly as well as compile on-the-fly to an HTML file that can be used for presentation. 

Note: The files named *foo.html* have individual slides, while the files named *foo_alt.html* have the same content but all on one page.

# Getting the workshop materials

To download the files, you can do any of the following. 

## From a browser

Simply go to [https://github.com/nimble-training/nimble-csu-2023](https://github.com/nimble-training/nimble-csu-2023) and click on the 'Download ZIP' button in the right side of the window or simply click [here](https://github.com/nimble-training/nimble-csu-2023/archive/main.zip).

## Within RStudio

Within RStudio go to File->New Project->Version Control->Git and enter:

- "Repository URL": https://github.com/nimble-training/nimble-csu-2023
- "Project Directory Name": nimble-csu-2023 (or something else of your choosing)
- "Directory": ~/Desktop (or somewhere of your choosing)

Then to update from the repository to get any changes we've made, you can select (from within RStudio):
Tools->Version Control->Pull Branches

or from the Environment/History/Git window, click on the Git tab and then on the blue down arrow.

Be warned that you probably do not want to make your own notes or changes to the files we are providing. Because if you do, and you then do a "Git Pull" to update the materials, you'll have to deal with the conflict between your local version and our version. You probably will want to make a personal copy of such files in another directory or by making copies of files with new names.

## From a terminal window

Run the following commands:

- `cd /directory/where/you/want/repository/located`
- `git clone https://github.com/nimble-training/nimble-csu-2023`

Then to update from the repository to get any changes we've made:

- `cd /directory/where/you/put/the/repository/nimble-csu-2023`
- `git pull`
